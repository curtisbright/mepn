MEPN Implementation
===================

The following programs are useful for computing minimal elements for prime numbers in various bases:

minimal:
	Computes minimal primes for bases between l and h,
	possibly along with a set of unsolved families
	Usage: ./minimal l h
	To resume base b from iteration i: ./minimal resume b i

simple:
	This program searches all unsolved simple families
	for prime candidates between exponents n and m,
	given on the command-line

sieving.start:
	Initializes sieve files for all unsolved simple families
	between exponents n and m, given on the command-line
	which may then be processed by programs sieving and search

sieving:
	Given a base on the command line, this program runs
	srsieve on that base sieve file and then
	merges the results with the LLR search data

	NOTE: The program srsieve must be located in the directory srsieve

search:
	After sieving has been done, this program uses LLR
	to search for prime candidates between exponents n and m
	Usage: ./search n m
	To only search base b: ./search n m b
	To only search the ith family in base b: ./search n m b i
	To search everything: ./search -

	NOTE: The program llr must be located in the base directory

merge:
	Merges the candidate lists in the data directory
	(used by llr) and the srsieve directory (used by srsieve)
	so that duplication of work does not occur

organize:
	Sorts the minimal primes and removes any extraneous elements

check:
	Checks the minimal primes using a pseduoprime test and
	creates candidate files suitable for testing with Primo

summary:
	Writes a summary of the minimal prime data
	computed for each base on the standard output

unsolved:
	Writes a summary of each unsolved family on the standard output
